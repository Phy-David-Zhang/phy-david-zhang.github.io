## Gauge Gravity Duality

### Introduction

This is a review of the well-renowned AdS/CFT correspondence, or Gauge/Gravity duality, as well as its application in computing the entanglement entropy. This duality maintains that there is a correspondence between a gravitational theory and a conformal field theory living in one lower dimension. The coupling strength of the two sides are opposite to each other and thus exhibit a soaring importance in various areas.
