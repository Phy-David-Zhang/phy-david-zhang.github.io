            <p style="margin-top: 2em">This is the main entrance of all works of <a href="About-My-Name" style="color: inherit;">Zhang Chang-kai</a>, including projects, articles and comments. My major devotion to physics concentrates on the theoretical and computational analysis of strongly correlated systems. As a growing physicist, most of my current accomplishments involve the refinements and philosophical insights towards well-established high energy and condensed matter theories.
            <!--
            For a long time, Zhang Chang-kai has been working on establishing logically self-complete physical theories. Motivated by this origin, he has accomplished skeletons from basic Mathematics towards classical gauge field theory, and is now working with hope to extend it into the quantum area.

            <h4>Research Interest</h4>
            <p>Recently, I am attracted by conducting theoretical and computational investigations via powerful tools including AdS/CFT correspondence and numerous tensor network algorithms in an attempt to resolve the mysteries in strongly correlated systems. Currently, I am working on the application of tensor networks to various quantum lattice models.</p>

            <p>Recently, I am attracted by conducting theoretical investigations of various aspects of Quantum Field Theory, High Energy Physics, as well as candidates for a theory of Quantum Gravity. Currently, I am working on investigating consequences of the AdS/CFT correspondence as well as its implications on quantum information.</p>

            The mathematical backgrounds for General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics have been constructed ever since the early ages of these two theories.
