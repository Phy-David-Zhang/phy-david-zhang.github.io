## Constructive Physics

### Introduction

Constructive Physics is an attempt to construct physical theories in a logically self-complete formulation. Among all established physical theories, only a few stand on a firm analytical background. The most fundamental and inclusive one is the classical gauge field theory, which is the framework of all the known fundamental forces. In this document, we introduce a self-contained analytical construction of classical gauge field theory. All the concepts mentioned in a definition should be found a definition in the previous context. Therefore, it can serve as a reference of the mathematical structure of the classical gauge field theory.
