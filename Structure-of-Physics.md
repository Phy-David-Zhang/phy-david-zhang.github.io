## Structure of Physics

### Introduction

This document illustrates the methodology and the construction of the fundamental theory of Physics. We show how to derive a physical theory based solely on mathematical requirements on self-consistency (symmetric principle). Under this idea, all classical theories are placed within a universal framework. The main body is written in an inspirational and revealing style. Consult the appendix for mathematical constructions and supplementary explications.
